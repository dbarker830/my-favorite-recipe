    <h1>Stir Fry: A Land of Cooking Wonders</h1>

    <p>I <b>love</b> stir fry because it is such a diverse style of cooking food. 
        <br> Most people think of stir fry being used in asian cuisines like in a shrimp fried rice. </b> 
        <br>A pretty generic recipe for stir fry would be white rice, a protein (such as chicken, steak, or shrimp), soy sauce, sesame oil, mirin, white/black sesame seeds, and an assortment of including broccoli, yellow squash, zucchini, and yellow onion to name a few.</br> 
    
    <hr>Although very different in ingredients, last week I found a stir fry recipe that used prosciutto, capicola, white/jasmine rice, and a homemade basil pesto sauce, all stir fried in a wok then served. Who would've thought that some of the most common Italian ingredients on the planet would be used in stir fry?! Certainly not me, until recently. </p>
